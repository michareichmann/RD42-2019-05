	\begin{itemize}\itemfill
		\item<1-> pulse height looks OK, but pedestal of unknown origin (cannot be real)
		\item<1-> Langau MPV: \SI{13500}{e}
		\item<1-> uniform efficiency
		\item<2> high efficiency of \SI{99.2\pm.1}{\%}

	\begin{itemize}\itemfill
		\item<1-> left part of pulse height distribution not understood
		\item<1-> Langau MPV: \SI{8000}{e}
		\item<1-> efficiency much less uniform \ra already loose bumps?
		\item<2> lower efficiency of \SI{97.3\pm.2}{\%}
