	\begin{itemize}\itemfill
		\item ROC = Plane
		\item resolution = width of the residual distribution at the plane under test
		\item can achieve \SI{\sim20}{\micro\meter} resolution at very low $\upchi^2$
		\item resolution at the front slightly better than in the back
		\begin{itemize}
			\item less multiple scattering
		\end{itemize}
% 		\item choose \SI{90}{\%} quantile to have a large number of events

	\begin{itemize}\itemfill
		\item less than \SI{20}{\%} of the tested diamonds show rate dependence \SI{>10}{\%}
		\item very large rate dependence at the first measurement (\SI{>90}{\%})
		\item after reprocessing and surface cleaning with RIE very stable behaviour (\SI{\sim2}{\%})
		\item feasible to ``fix'' bad diamonds
